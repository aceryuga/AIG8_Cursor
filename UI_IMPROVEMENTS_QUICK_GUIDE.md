## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Finalize button disabled
**Solution:** Make sure there are auto-matched payments (green count > 0)

### Issue: Tenant warning showing incorrectly
**Note:** Only shows when tenant name is COMPLETELY absent from bank description. Partial matches don't trigger warning.

### Issue: Can't see match reasons
**Solution:** Click the info icon (ℹ️) next to confidence percentage. Only shows when confidence > 0.

### Issue: Session won't finalize
**Note:** If review required items exist, session stays active. This is intentional - complete reviews to fully finalize.

### Issue: Can't edit finalized session
**Expected:** Finalized sessions are read-only. This prevents accidental changes to completed reconciliations.
