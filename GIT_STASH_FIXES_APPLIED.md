# Git Stash Fixes Applied - Summary

## Date: October 13, 2025

This document summarizes all the fixes that were applied from `git stash@{0}` to restore critical functionality while preserving teammate's work.

---

## âœ… 1. Rent Calculation Fix (COMPLETED)

### Issue
- Property `3ebb55c7-15db-45fa-a8b9-97754610ac31` showed incorrect due amount
- Dashboard and Payment History pages were including non-rent payments (security deposits, maintenance) in rent calculations

### Fix Applied
**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/rentCalculations.ts` - Added `payment_type?: string` to Payment interface
- `src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx` - Added `payment_type: payment.payment_type` to payment mapping (lines 562-568 and 626-632)
- `src/components/payments/PaymentHistory.tsx` - Added `payment_type: payment.payment_type` to payment mapping (lines 169-175)

### Verification
âœ… Dashboard now shows correct overdue amount: **â‚¹6,009**
âœ… Payment History metrics are accurate
âœ… Test Property 1 correctly shows as "overdue" instead of "paid"

---

## âœ… 2. Security Enhancements (COMPLETED)

### LoginPage.tsx
**Security Fixes:**
- Added email input sanitization using `sanitizeEmail()` before validation and submission
- Prevents XSS attacks and SQL injection through email field
- Improved redirect logic using `location.state` for better UX

**Teammate's Work Preserved:**
- Kept commented onboarding code for future implementation:
  ```javascript
  // Check if this is a first-time user
  //const isFirstTime = !localStorage.getItem('propertypro_onboarded');
  //if (isFirstTime) {
   // navigate('/onboarding');
  //} else {
  ```

### SignupPage.tsx
**Security Fixes:**
- Added input sanitization for:
  - Name field: `sanitizeText()`
  - Email field: `sanitizeEmail()`
  - Phone field: `sanitizePhone()`
- Prevents XSS attacks and malicious input during registration

**Implementation Note:**
All sanitization functions are imported from `src/utils/security.ts` which already exists in the codebase.

---

## âœ… 3. Error Handling (COMPLETED)

### App.tsx
**Changes:**
- Added `ErrorBoundary` wrapper around the entire app
- Added `ProtectedRoute` wrapper for all authenticated routes
- Added `GlobalLayout` wrapper for consistent layout across protected pages
- Added catch-all route to redirect invalid URLs to landing page
- **Preserved:** Teammate's `AIChatbot` component remains functional

**Structure:**
```jsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <Router>
    <Routes>
      {/* Public Routes */}
      <Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
      <Route path="/auth/*" element={<AuthPages />} />
      
      {/* Protected Routes */}
      <Route path="/dashboard" element={
        <ProtectedRoute>
          <GlobalLayout>
            <Dashboard />
          </GlobalLayout>
        </ProtectedRoute>
      } />
      {/* ... more protected routes ... */}
    </Routes>
    
    {/* AIChatbot preserved from teammate's work */}
    <AIChatbot position={chatbotPosition} onPositionChange={setChatbotPosition} />
  </Router>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### main.tsx
**Changes:**
- Added global error handler initialization
- Imports `initializeErrorHandlers()` from `src/utils/errorHandler.ts`
- Catches unhandled JavaScript errors and promise rejections
- Logs errors to `error_logs` table in Supabase

**Benefits:**
- Catches runtime errors and prevents app crashes
- Provides user-friendly error UI instead of blank screens
- Automatically logs errors to database for debugging
- Development mode shows detailed error stack traces

## ðŸ”„ 4. Audit Trail (NOT YET APPLIED)

### Status: Pending

### What it does:
The git stash version actually **disables** audit trail logging (currently it logs to Supabase):

**Current behavior:** Audit events are stored in `audit_events` table
**Git stash behavior:** Audit events are only logged to console (not stored)

### Reason for change in stash:
The git stash suggests the `audit_events` table may not exist or needs to be implemented differently.

### Decision needed:
- Should we keep the current audit trail functionality?
- Or switch to console-only logging as in the stash?
- Or verify/create the `audit_events` table?

---

## ðŸ”„ 5. Property Gallery Improvements (NOT YET APPLIED)

### Status: Pending Review

### Changes in git stash:
- `src/components/properties/PropertyGallery.tsx`
  - Added `onPrimaryImageChange` callback prop
  - Improved file upload handling
  - Better error handling for image operations

### Recommendation:
Review and apply if these improvements are needed for gallery functionality.

## Testing Completed

### Browser Testing:
1. âœ… Dashboard loads correctly with accurate rent calculations
2. âœ… Overdue amount shows â‚¹6,009 (correct)
3. âœ… Payment History shows accurate metrics
4. âœ… AIChatbot visible and functional
5. âœ… Error handlers initialized (console log confirms)
6. âœ… All protected routes are wrapped correctly

### Console Output:
- "Global error handlers initialized" âœ…
- No new errors introduced âœ…
- HMR updates working correctly âœ…

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to apply the remaining fixes:

1. **Review Audit Trail Behavior**
   - Decide if audit events should be stored or just logged
   - Verify `audit_events` table exists in Supabase
   
2. **Review Property Gallery Improvements**
   - Check if `onPrimaryImageChange` callback is needed
   - Apply if gallery needs enhancement

---

## Notes

- All security sanitization uses existing utility functions from `src/utils/security.ts`
- Error logging uses existing `error_logs` table in Supabase
- Protected routes check trial status and authentication
- Error boundary provides graceful error handling with user-friendly UI
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All teammate's work (onboarding, chatbot) has been preserved

## Verification Commands

To verify the fixes are working:

```bash
# Check for any lint errors
npm run lint

# Run the dev server
npm run dev

# Test login at http://localhost:5173/#/auth/login
# Use demo credentials to verify protected routes
```
