## 🔄 Deletion Order (Foreign Key Compliant)

The deletion order has been carefully designed to respect all foreign key constraints:

```
STORAGE DELETION (First):
├── property-images bucket (all files for user's properties)
└── documents bucket (all files uploaded by user)

DATABASE DELETION (In Order):
1.  payments → (references lease_id)
2.  rental_increases → (references lease_id)
3.  communication_log → (references lease_id, tenant_id)
4.  documents → (references property_id, lease_id, tenant_id)
5.  property_images → (references property_id)
6.  maintenance_requests → (references property_id, tenant_id)
7.  leases → (references property_id, tenant_id)
8.  tenants.current_property_id → NULL (update to remove FK constraint)
9.  [tenants deleted if owned by user]
10. properties → (references owner_id)
11. notifications → (references user_id, property_id, lease_id, tenant_id)
12. email_tokens → (references user_id)
13. user_subscriptions → (references user_id)
14. user_settings → (references user_id)
15. data_export_requests → (references user_id)
16. users → (final deletion)

AUTH DELETION (Last):
└── auth.users (via Supabase Auth API, if admin privileges available)

PRESERVED (Audit/Compliance):
├── error_logs (ON DELETE SET NULL)
├── audit_events (ON DELETE SET NULL)
├── login_activity (audit trail)
└── billing_history (financial records, CASCADE via user_id)
```

- [ ] Dialog shows comprehensive list of what will be deleted

### **Functionality Tests (CAUTION - USE TEST ACCOUNT):**

- [ ] Click "Cancel" - dialog closes, no action taken
- [ ] Click "Delete Account" with test account:
  - [ ] Loading state shows during deletion
  - [ ] Console logs show deletion progress

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Admin Privileges for Auth Deletion:**
   - The `supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser()` call requires admin API key
   - If client-side execution fails, implement via Edge Function with admin key
   - Current implementation logs warning but continues with other deletions

2. **Tenant Ownership:**
   - Current implementation updates `tenants.current_property_id` to NULL
   - Actual tenant deletion is commented out (depends on schema ownership model)
   - Verify if tenants should be deleted or just unlinked

3. **Billing History:**
   - Marked as "preserved" but has `ON DELETE CASCADE` on user_id
   - Will be automatically deleted when user is deleted
   - Matches requirement to exclude from explicit deletion list

4. **Testing Safety:**
   - **DO NOT TEST WITH PRODUCTION/REAL ACCOUNTS**
   - Create dedicated test account with sample data
   - Verify backups are in place before testing
   - Test in development environment first

---

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

**All code is in place and verified:**
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Foreign key order validated against schema
- ✅ Storage cleanup implemented
- ✅ UI changes completed
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Audit tables excluded

**You can now test the implementation with a test account.**

## 📞 Support

If any issues arise during testing:
1. Check browser console for detailed logs
2. Verify Supabase logs for database errors
3. Check storage bucket access permissions
4. Ensure RLS policies allow deletion operations
5. Verify user has proper authentication

**The implementation is complete and ready for your testing!**
