# ✅ View Option & Scoring Fixes - Complete

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **BOTH FIXES COMPLETE AND TESTED**

---

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **View Option Not Working** ✅ FIXED & TESTED

**Problem:**  
Clicking the eye icon (👁️) in the Reconciliation History page was navigating to dashboard instead of opening the session details.

**Root Cause:**  
Route mismatch! The code was navigating to `/payments/ai-reconciliation` but the actual route in `App.tsx` is `/payments/reconciliation`.

**Fix Applied:**
Updated all navigation links in `ReconciliationHistory.tsx` to use the correct route:
- `handleViewSession()`: `/payments/reconciliation?session=${sessionId}` ✅
- "New Reconciliation" button: `/payments/reconciliation` ✅
- Breadcrumb link: `/payments/reconciliation` ✅

**Test Result:** ✅ **PASSED**
- Clicked "View Details" button
- URL correctly changed to: `http://localhost:5173/#/payments/reconciliation?session=0a034ab4-dcf6-4d7d-8023-e76c6861cb8e`
- Navigation is working perfectly!

### 2. **Remove Scoring from Match Reasons** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**  
Match reasons tooltip was showing technical point values like "(40 pts)", "(25 pts)" which were confusing for end users.

**User Request:**  
Make tooltips simpler and more user-friendly without scoring details.

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `getMatchReasons()` function in `AIReconciliation.tsx` to remove all point references.
