# 🔄 Fix Browser Cache Issue

## Problem
Your browser was using **old cached JavaScript** that still had the `supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser()` code instead of the new Edge Function call.

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've rebuilt the application with the updated code:
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Option 1: Hard Refresh (Quickest)**

1. **Clear browser cache for your app:**
   - **Chrome/Edge:** `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
   - **Firefox:** `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + F5` (Windows)
   - **Safari:** `Cmd + Option + E` then reload

2. **Or manually clear cache:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Right-click the reload button
   - Click "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### **Option 2: Restart Dev Server (Recommended)**

If you're running `npm run dev`:

1. **Stop the dev server** (Ctrl + C in terminal)
2. **Clear Vite cache:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   ```
3. **Restart dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### **Option 3: Use Built Version**

The production build is now ready in `dist/` folder:

1. **Serve the built version:**
   ```bash
   npx serve dist
   ```

2. **Or deploy to Netlify/Vercel** with the new build

## 🧪 Test Again

After clearing cache/restarting:

1. **Create test account**
2. **Delete account** (Settings > Profile)
3. **Check console logs** - should now see:
   ```
   ✅ Calling delete-user Edge Function...
   ✅ Auth user deleted successfully via Edge Function
   ```
4. **Sign up again** with same email - should work!

---

## 🎯 Expected New Logs

**Before (old cached code):**
```
❌ Could not delete auth user (may require admin API): AuthApiError: User not allowed
```

**After (new code with Edge Function):**
```
✅ Calling delete-user Edge Function...
✅ Auth user deleted successfully via Edge Function
✅ User data purge completed successfully
```

---

## 🔍 Verify Edge Function is Working

Check in browser console after deletion:
1. Look for "Calling delete-user Edge Function..." message
2. Should NOT see "Could not delete auth user" error
3. Should see success message from Edge Function

## 📝 Summary

- ✅ Code updated correctly
- ✅ Application rebuilt
- ⏳ Need to clear browser cache or restart dev server
- ⏳ Then test again

**Clear your cache and try again!** 🚀
