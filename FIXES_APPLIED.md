# 🔧 Bug Fixes Applied

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **View Option Not Working** ✅

**Problem:** Clicking the eye icon (👁️) in History page wasn't opening the session details.

**Root Cause:** Navigation path mismatch
- History was navigating to: `/payments/reconciliation?session=${sessionId}`
- Correct route should be: `/payments/ai-reconciliation?session=${sessionId}`

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Updated `handleViewSession()` in `ReconciliationHistory.tsx`
- ✅ Updated "New Reconciliation" button link
- ✅ Navigation now uses correct route: `/payments/ai-reconciliation?session=${sessionId}`

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/payments/ReconciliationHistory.tsx`

### 2. **Remove Scoring from Match Reasons** ✅

**Problem:** Match reasons tooltip showed technical point values like "(40 pts)", "(25 pts)" etc.

**User Request:** Make it simpler and more user-friendly without scoring details.

**Changed From:**
```
✓ Amount: Exact match (40 pts)
✓ Date: Same day (30 pts)
✓ Reference: Exact match (30 pts)
✓ Tenant: Full name match (25 pts)
```

**Changed To:**
```
✓ Amount: Exact match
✓ Date: Same day
✓ Reference: Exact match
✓ Tenant: Full name match
```

**All Scoring References Removed:**
- Amount messages: No more "(40 pts)", "(35 pts)", "(25 pts)"
- Date messages: No more "(30 pts)", "(25 pts)", "(15 pts)", "(10 pts)", "(-20 pts)"
- Reference messages: No more "(30 pts)", "(20 pts)", "(0 pts)"
- Tenant messages: No more "(25 pts)", "(15 pts)", "(0 pts)"

**Better User-Friendly Messages:**
- "Within ₹1 difference" instead of "Within ₹1 (35 pts)"
- "2 days apart" instead of "Within 2 days (25 pts)"
- "Partial match found" instead of "Partial match (20 pts)"
- "Significant mismatch (₹X difference)" for large amount differences

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/payments/AIReconciliation.tsx`
