# ✅ View Details Fix - Complete & Tested

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - READ-ONLY HISTORY VIEW NOW WORKING**

---

## 🐛 Problem

When clicking "View Details" (eye icon 👁️) in the Reconciliation History page:
- ❌ Was showing the "Start New Reconciliation" upload interface
- ❌ Session details were not loading
- ❌ No error messages displayed
- ❌ Expected: Show detailed read-only view of the session

**User's Feedback:**  
> "It is now routing to start new reconciliation. Expectation is it should show me detailed history read-only page."

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The bug was in the `useEffect` hook that loads existing sessions:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Line 128-133) - BROKEN
useEffect(() => {
  const sessionIdFromUrl = searchParams.get('session');
  if (sessionIdFromUrl) {
    loadExistingSession(sessionIdFromUrl);  // ❌ Calls before user is loaded
  }
}, [searchParams]);  // ❌ Missing 'user' dependency
```

**The Problem:**
1. Component mounts with `?session={id}` in URL
2. `useEffect` runs immediately
3. `user` from AuthContext hasn't loaded yet
4. `loadExistingSession` checks `if (!user) return;` (line 139)
5. Function silently exits without loading session
6. Component stays in default 'upload' workflow state
7. User sees upload interface instead of session details

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Added `user` to the `useEffect` dependencies and checked for its presence:

```typescript
// AFTER (Line 128-133) - FIXED ✅
useEffect(() => {
  const sessionIdFromUrl = searchParams.get('session');
  if (sessionIdFromUrl && user) {  // ✅ Check user exists
    loadExistingSession(sessionIdFromUrl);
  }
}, [searchParams, user]);  // ✅ Added user dependency
```

**How it works now:**
1. Component mounts with `?session={id}` in URL
2. `useEffect` waits for `user` to be loaded
3. When `user` is available, `useEffect` re-runs
4. `loadExistingSession` successfully queries database
5. Session data loads → workflow state changes to 'results'
6. User sees detailed read-only view ✅
