# 🧪 Error Handling & Audit Trail Testing Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Error Handling System**
- **React Error Boundary**: Catches component crashes and logs to `error_logs` table
- **Global JavaScript Error Handler**: Catches unhandled errors and promise rejections
- **API Error Handler**: Logs API failures to database
- **Error Logging**: All errors stored in `error_logs` table with user context

### 2. **Audit Trail System**
- **Property Audit Events**: Tracks property creation, updates, deletions
- **Payment Audit Events**: Tracks payment recording and modifications
- **Lease Audit Events**: Tracks lease management activities
- **Audit Logging**: All events stored in `audit_events` table with full context

### 3. **Database Tables**
- **`error_logs`**: Stores all application errors with user context
- **`audit_events`**: Stores all user actions and system changes
- **Both tables**: Include RLS policies and proper indexing

### 4. **Test Component**
- **Comprehensive Testing Interface**: Built into Settings page
- **Real-time Testing**: Test error handling and audit trails
- **Database Verification**: Check if data is being stored correctly

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Method 1: Using the Test Component (Recommended)**

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login to the application** (required for audit trail testing)

3. **Navigate to Settings**:
   - Go to `/settings` or click Settings in the navigation

4. **Access the Test Section**:
   - Click on "Error & Audit Testing" in the sidebar

5. **Run Tests**:
   - **Test JavaScript Error**: Triggers a JavaScript error and logs it
   - **Test Promise Rejection**: Triggers an unhandled promise rejection
   - **Test Property Audit**: Creates a test property and verifies audit trail
   - **Test Payment Audit**: Creates a test payment and verifies audit trail
   - **Check Error Logs**: Shows recent error logs from database
   - **Check Audit Events**: Shows recent audit events from database

### **Method 2: Using Browser Console**

1. **Open browser console** on the application
2. **Run the database connection test**:
   ```javascript
   // Copy and paste the content of test-database-connection.js
   ```

3. **Run the simple test**:
   ```javascript
   // Copy and paste the content of test-simple.js
   ```

### **Method 3: Manual Testing**

1. **Test Error Boundary**:
   - Navigate to a page that might have errors
   - Check browser console for error logs
   - Verify errors appear in `error_logs` table

2. **Test Audit Trail**:
   - Create a new property
   - Record a payment
   - Check `audit_events` table for new entries

## 📊 Expected Results

### **Error Logging Tests**
- ✅ JavaScript errors should be caught and logged
- ✅ Promise rejections should be caught and logged
- ✅ React component errors should be caught and logged
- ✅ All errors should appear in `error_logs` table

### **Audit Trail Tests**
- ✅ Property creation should create audit event
- ✅ Payment recording should create audit event
- ✅ All audit events should appear in `audit_events` table
- ✅ Audit events should include user context and timestamps

### **Database Verification**
- ✅ `error_logs` table should be accessible
- ✅ `audit_events` table should be accessible
- ✅ Data should be inserted successfully
- ✅ User context should be preserved

## 🔍 Monitoring Queries

### **Check Recent Errors**
```sql
SELECT * FROM error_logs 
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### **Check Recent Audit Events**
```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_events 
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### **Check Error Types**
```sql
SELECT error_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM error_logs 
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY error_type;
```

### **Check Audit Event Types**
```sql
SELECT type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM audit_events 
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY type;
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **If Tests Fail**

1. **Check Database Connection**:
   - Verify Supabase connection is working
   - Check if tables exist in database
   - Verify RLS policies are set up

2. **Check User Authentication**:
   - Ensure user is logged in for audit trail tests
   - Verify user ID is being captured correctly

3. **Check Console Errors**:
   - Look for JavaScript errors in browser console
   - Check for network errors in Network tab

4. **Check Database Permissions**:
   - Verify user has INSERT permissions on tables
   - Check RLS policies allow data insertion

### **Common Issues**

- **"Table doesn't exist"**: Run the SQL scripts to create tables
- **"Permission denied"**: Check RLS policies
- **"User not authenticated"**: Login to the application first
- **"No data in tables"**: Check if tests are actually running

## 📈 Success Criteria

The testing is successful if:

1. ✅ **Error Handling Works**:
   - JavaScript errors are caught and logged
   - React errors are caught and logged
   - Errors appear in `error_logs` table

2. ✅ **Audit Trail Works**:
   - Property actions create audit events
   - Payment actions create audit events
   - Audit events appear in `audit_events` table

3. ✅ **Database Integration Works**:
   - Tables are accessible
   - Data is being inserted
   - User context is preserved

4. ✅ **Real-time Monitoring Works**:
   - Can query recent errors
   - Can query recent audit events
   - Data is properly timestamped

## 🎯 Next Steps

After successful testing:

1. **Monitor Production**: Use the monitoring scripts to track errors and audit events
2. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts for critical errors
3. **Regular Maintenance**: Run cleanup scripts to manage data growth
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor query performance and optimize as needed

---

*This testing framework ensures that both error handling and audit trail systems are working correctly and can be monitored in production.*
