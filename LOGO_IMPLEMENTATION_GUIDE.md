# Logo Implementation Guide

## Overview
I've successfully replaced all Building2 icons throughout your webapp with a new Logo component that can display your custom logo image. Here's what has been implemented and what you need to do next.

## What's Been Done

### 1. Created Logo Component
- **File**: `src/components/ui/Logo.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Responsive sizing (sm, md, lg, xl)
  - Fallback to "PP" text if image fails to load
  - Proper error handling

### 2. Replaced All Building2 Icons
The following components now use the new Logo component:
- ✅ Header (`src/components/ui/header.tsx`)
- ✅ Dashboard (`src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ AuthLayout (`src/components/auth/AuthLayout.tsx`)
- ✅ PropertiesList (`src/components/properties/PropertiesList.tsx`)
- ✅ PropertyDetails (`src/components/properties/PropertyDetails.tsx`)
- ✅ AddProperty (`src/components/properties/AddProperty.tsx`)
- ✅ SettingsPage (`src/components/settings/SettingsPage.tsx`)
- ✅ All payment components
- ✅ All document components
- ✅ OnboardingWizard
- ✅ Gallery page
- ✅ Settings page

## Next Steps - Upload Your Logo Image

### Option 1: GitHub Raw URL (Recommended for Production)
1. **Upload your logo image to GitHub**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to the `public` folder
   - Upload your logo image (preferably as `logo.png`)
   - Commit the changes

2. **Get the raw URL**:
   - Right-click on the uploaded image in GitHub
   - Select "Copy image address" or "Copy link address"
   - The URL should look like: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepo/main/public/logo.png`

3. **Update the Logo component**:
   - Open `src/components/ui/Logo.tsx`
   - Replace the `logoUrl` variable with your GitHub raw URL:
   ```typescript
   const logoUrl = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepo/main/public/logo.png';
   ```

### Option 2: Local Development (Current Setup)
The current setup uses `/logo.png` which works for local development. The image should be placed in the `public` folder of your project.

## Logo Sizing Guidelines

The Logo component supports different sizes:
- **sm**: 24x24px (used in navigation bars)
- **md**: 32x32px (used in headers)
- **lg**: 48x48px (used in auth pages)
- **xl**: 64x64px (used in large displays)

## Image Requirements

For best results, your logo should:
- Be a PNG or SVG file
- Have a transparent background
- Be square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Be high resolution (at least 256x256px)
- Work well on both light and dark backgrounds

## Testing

After uploading your logo:
1. **Local Development**: Run `npm run dev` and check all pages
2. **Production**: Deploy to Netlify and verify the logo appears correctly
3. **Fallback**: If the image fails to load, you should see "PP" as a fallback

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Appearing
- Check the URL is correct and accessible
- Verify the image file exists in the repository
- Check browser console for any 404 errors

### Logo Too Large/Small
- Adjust the `size` prop in the Logo component usage
- Modify the `sizeClasses` in `Logo.tsx` if needed

### Production Issues
- Ensure the GitHub raw URL is correct
- Check that the image is in the correct repository branch
- Verify the image file is not corrupted

## Current Status
- ✅ Logo component created
- ✅ All Building2 icons replaced
- ⏳ **PENDING**: Upload actual logo image and update URL

## Files Modified
- `src/components/ui/Logo.tsx` (new file)
- `src/components/ui/header.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`
- `src/components/auth/AuthLayout.tsx`
- `src/components/properties/PropertiesList.tsx`
- `src/components/properties/PropertyDetails.tsx`
- `src/components/properties/AddProperty.tsx`
- `src/components/settings/SettingsPage.tsx`
- All payment components
- All document components
- OnboardingWizard
- Gallery page
- Settings page

The logo implementation is complete and ready for your custom image!
